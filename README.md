spaRSS DecSync is a fork of [spaRSS](https://github.com/Etuldan/spaRSS) which adds synchronization using [DecSync](https://github.com/39aldo39/DecSync). To start synchronizing, all you have to do is synchronize the directory `DecSync` located in the primary external storage, using for example [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net).
